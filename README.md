## Tallyface

Tallyface is a simple React webapp that updates a cartoon face in real time based on the score entries of a form, reflecting miserable, sad, neutral, happy, or ecstatic scores. The score updates as the user adds or subtracts.

At the end of the form there is a button that will calculate the final total of the score and give a breakdown as to which categories were the worst and best. At this point the form could be submit to the company with some additional comments from the user.
